ðŸŽ¯ Perya Shot (ARCHERY MODE ) - The Carnival Game Web App

Perya Shot is a full-stack web application simulating a classic Filipino carnival shooting or can-tossing game. This project features user authentication, persistent score tracking, and profile management, all powered by a Node.js backend and a MySQL database.

âœ¨ Features

User Authentication: Secure registration and login using a REST API and bcryptjs for password hashing.

Interactive Game: A Canvas-based game (game.html) where users can aim and shoot at moving targets.

Profile Management: Users can view and update their username, email, and profile picture URL.

Persistent Scores: High scores and user data are saved in a MySQL database.

Leaderboard: The backend supports fetching the top 10 scores (though the frontend implementation may vary).

ðŸš€ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

1. Prerequisites

You will need the following installed on your machine:

Node.js (and npm)

MySQL Server

2. Database Setup

The backend relies on a MySQL database named perya_shot.

Create the Database:

CREATE DATABASE perya_shot;
USE perya_shot;


Create the Tables:
The server.js file suggests the following schema for users and scores:

-- Users Table
CREATE TABLE users (
    user_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL, -- Stores the hashed password
    profile_pic_url VARCHAR(512)
);

-- Scores Table
CREATE TABLE scores (
    score_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT NOT NULL,
    score INT NOT NULL,
    timestamp DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(user_id)
);


Configure Connection:
Ensure your MySQL connection details in server.js are correct. By default, it uses:

const db = mysql.createConnection({
  host: "localhost",
  user: "root", // Change this if your user is different
  password: "", // Add your MySQL password here
  database: "perya_shot",
});


3. Backend Installation and Run

Install Dependencies: Navigate to the project root directory and install the necessary Node.js packages:

npm install


Start the Server: Run the Express server. It will run on port 3000.

npm start
# or
node server.js


4. Frontend Access

With the backend server running, you can access the application:

Open the Login Page: Open index.html in your web browser.

Register: Create a new account.

Login: Use your new credentials to log in. This will redirect you to game.html.

Note: The HTML files use http://localhost:3000 for API calls, ensuring a seamless connection to your running backend.
